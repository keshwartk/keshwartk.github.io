            <p>
               My friend Aravind had an idea. He knew that there were valuable conversations about art that occured during classes or casual discussions, but these conversations were more rare than they should be. <b>How could we facilitate better conversation among the art community?</b>
           </p>
           <p>
               The idea was interesting, and eventually we built it out as a mobile web app structured as an events calendar with a focus on user comments.
           </p>
           <p>
               Ultimately the app flopped, but with our fail-fast mentality going into it, we were able to take it as a learning experience without using unnecessary time
               and resources.
           </p>
            <hr><br>
            <div class="text">
              <h3 class="uppercase"><b>Process</b></h3>
              <p>
                  We went into the process with the desire of having an MVP, so we used quick and efficient techniques to have our product ready in time for
                  quick validation.
              </p>
              <h5>Prototyping</h5>
              <p>
                 We started with an extremely low fidelity "prototype" to figure out the basic functionalities of the application. I went to a gallery event with a small
                 notebook, and wrote something down every time I felt compelled to use the app.
             </p>
             <figure>
               <img class="img-thumbnail headroom-xs legroom-xs" src="../images/critter/sketchbook.jpg" alt="lo-fi prototype" style=" display: block; margin: auto;margin-bottom: 1.5%;">
               <figcaption class="caption">Prototype exercise</figcaption>
             </figure>
             <p>
                 From this we gained valuable insights at when a person might use this during their gallery experience and how a person might interact with others while
                 using it.
             </p>

             <h5>Design &amp; Development</h5>
             <p>
               First we tried to use an open-source forum software (phpBB) to develop the product, but it lacked the customization options necessary to create an easy-to-use web application.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img class="img-thumbnail headroom-xs legroom-xs" src="../images/critter/phpbb.jpg" alt="critter" style=" display: block; margin: auto;margin-bottom: 1.5%;">
              <figcaption class="caption">Critter running on the clunky phpBB platform</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              We then called on our friend Venkatesh, a seasoned developer who agreed to jump on board the project. We then decided we’d build the mobile web app from scratch.
              Venkatesh would handle the backend and databases (using Perl and SQL) while I would handle the front-end (HTML, CSS, and Twitter Bootstrap).
            </p>
            <hr><br>

            <p>Aravind and I took to the whiteboard, and eventually came up with the app’s user flows and general layout.</p>

              For the logo we called up another friend with a strong visual design background, and iterated until we got to our fun little
              "critter" (derived from the word "critique"):

            <!-- </a> -->

            <br />
            <h5>Launch</h5>
            <p>
               We prepared our table outside of the Lory Studen Center with a purple tablecloth and matching balloons, as well as lollipops (as I said, low budget).
           </p>
           <p>
               As people filtered in, we asked them if they wanted a lollipop, and gave a small pitch about what Critter was and how they could use it. We talked to
               nearly 100 people, but a problem began to quickly emerge: many of the people we spoke to are not into art. This was not something we had considered while developing. A lot of people seemed interested in the idea, and we had 13 sign-ups by the end of the night.
           </p>
           <p>
               Four hours later, we broke down for the night, and not a single comment had been posted. There could have been many reasons as to why this occurred, but after
               much thought we decided the overwhelming disinterest was enough to discontinue the project.
          </p>
          </div>

          <hr><br>
          <div class="text">
            <h3 class="uppercase"><b>What I Would Do Differently</b></h3></br>
            <p>
                Conducting more initial user research would have led to earlier invalidation of our original idea, which could have possibly lead to new similar concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our launch was not extremely well planned. Providing further motivation in some form for users to sign up and comment may have helped to drive usage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than treating the lack of interest as a failure, we could have looked into pivoting to find other places for growth.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr><br>

        <div class="text">
          <h3 class="uppercase"><b>What Went Well</b></h3></br>
          <p>
              We went into the project with a fail-fast mentality, and we were able to release an MVP. Even if it failed, we were successful in our
              pursuit of learning.
          </p>
          <p>
              I was able to hone my HTML and CSS skills by applying them to a tangible project.
          </p>
          <p>
              Leading the full ideation-design-iteration-development process was incredibly interesting and I gained confidence to be able to go through a similar
              process in the future.

  <h3 class="uppercase"><b>Process</b></h3><br />
  <p>The goals of the study included gaining an understanding of the client’s
  potential users and current users extrapolated from their “Ambitious Learner” market segment
  from previous research. The study focused on understanding how people develop a relationship
  with a source that they trust, and how an immersive experience differs from a utilitarian one.
  Expanding the Ambitious Learner segment will give the client the opportunity to gain further
  stakeholder investment, as well as to help the company to understand their users’ behaviors.
  These personas were also expanded upon to explain why a person might be dedicated to a
  resource, and why they might rely on it through and after transitional periods in their careers.</p>
  <p>The initial personas that were developed in this study did not accurately reflect the
  resulting personas created by the study’s close. The interviews with five young professional
  participants focused on their ideas of trust and how they use resources in their career path.
  Further analysis also revealed trends about the participants’ behaviors related to trust, loyalty,
  bias, and exploration styles. Trust comes in many varieties and people trust in a wide variety of
  things, from their bank, family, favorite football coach, shotgun, or themselves. While some
  people valued gaining absolute truths from their trusted figures, others looked for reliability or
  comfort. This wide range from a small demographic revealed some of the inaccuracies of the
  current market segment that is established at the company, with suggestions on how to improve
  and expand upon the current idea of what an Ambitious Learner’s behaviors are.</p>
  <p>Many conclusions were drawn based on these five participants, but this needs to be
  combined with further similar research in order to be validated. More persona research should
  be completed to find more concise patterns within the “Ambitious Learner” segment to hone in
  on the “Fast Tasker” and “Wanderer” personas that have emerged from this study. Also a
  continuation of research should inquire about more information on a person’s immediate
  motivation to access a resource (such as the client); for example, what question do they want
  answered by the time they have completed reading this article? The following research allows
  the client to dive deeper into their potential user base and to elaborate upon their market
  segments to cater more to the people who can best use the client’s resources.</p>
