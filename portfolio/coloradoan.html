          <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-12">
            <p>Our final report consisted of interviewing 5 users based on a client project. The client was a popular business magazine, and we were tasked with extrapolating findings on how users trust resources (such as magazines, mentors, or news sources). </p>
            <p>After the client briefing, I came up with a set of research questions that would drive the project and meet the company's goals:</p>
            <hr><br>
          <div class="text">
            <h3>Primary Research Questions</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>What are the attitudes and behaviors of Ambitious Learners* and what are the subdivisions of that market segment?</li>
                <li>When people go through a career transition, why do they keep some resources while abandoning others?</li>

            <h3>Secondary Research Questions</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>What makes people trust something?</li>
                <li>Why do people develop an ongoing relationship with a resource?</li>
                <li>How do young professionals absorb work-related content?</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          <hr><br>
          <div class="text">
            <h3>Process</h3>
              <p>This was an individual project that included a schedule, budget, user research study, analysis, personas, recommendations, and a final report deliverable to be submitted to the client.</p>
            <figure>

            <h5>Interviews</h5>
              <p>To extract more nuanced ideas about people’s trust and exploration strategies, I chose to conduct one-on-one interviews that might unveil personal stories that may have been withheld in a focus group setting. I created a thorough discussion guide that was divided into three sections: Trust &amp; Loyalty, Ranking Activity, and Exploration Styles. </p>

              <p>The “trust &amp; loyalty” and “exploration styles” sections were conducted in a traditional interview format. Questions were asked to unveil behaviors and personal stories around these subjects rather than the participant’s attitudes. For example, in the “trust &amp; loyalty” section, participants were asked about their allegiance to college sports teams, mentors, and frequented restaurants. </p>

              <p>The ranking activity was meant to break up the 1-hour interview by asking the participant to arrange a set of 15 cards with information sources on them (e.g. CNN, BuzzFeed, and Reddit) from most to least trustworthy, then from most to least enjoyable.</p>

            <h5>Analysis</h5>
              <p>Once the 5 sessions were complete, I referenced my notes and the recordings to affinity map my findings into 6 overarching groups: trust, resources, bias, upward mobility, immersion, and loyalty. Here is part of a finding from the final report:</p><br />

              <blockquote>
                <h4>Resources</h4>
                <i>“I use Stack Overflow every single day. I wouldn’t be where I am without that website… You have really good developers teaching you essentially by example.”</i>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                All of the participants mentioned <i>people</i> as being reliable resources for upward mobility in their careers, often by asking questions or giving career guidance. The participants often mentioned that if they could avoid asking a simple question to co-workers or superiors in the workplace, they would do so and try to find the answer elsewhere before asking.
              </blockquote>
          </div>
          <hr><br>
          <div class="text">
            <h5>Personas</h5>
            <p>Through further analysis, two personas began to emerge: “Wanderers” and “Fast Taskers.” Two participants were Wanderers, two participants were Fast Taskers, and one participant was an outlier. Here's part of the "Wanderer" persona:</p><br />

            <blockquote>
              <h4>Wanderers</h4>
              <i>“I think of things that wouldn’t lie to me… something that I knew I would get the same answer every time I asked a question to it"</i>
              <p>
                <br/>
                Comfort is important for them in order to trust something
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Looks for truth, but understands and values opinions from sources
              </p>
            </blockquote>
          </div>
          <hr><br>
          <div class="text">
            <h5>Recommendations</h5>
            I recommended that further research should be conducted to solidify and expand upon the personas that were found in my research with a larger sample size.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            At the end of the project, the final report was sent to the company.

            <h3>What I Would Do Differently</h3>
            <p>
              Since I had never done qualitative analyis before, more thorough planning of the analysis stage would have created a more efficient research process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Examining prior academic research on the themes of trust and loyalty could have supported some of the user interviews and analysis.

          <div class="text">
            <h3>What Went Well</h3>
              <p>
                Starting with a well-defined project schedule kept me on track to submit deliverables on time while allowing room for creative exploration and spontaneity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The discussion guide was well composed to keep participants engaged as well as to answer the research questions.

  <h3 class="uppercase"><b>Process</b></h3><br />
  <p>The goals of the study included gaining an understanding of the client’s
  potential users and current users extrapolated from their “Ambitious Learner” market segment
  from previous research. The study focused on understanding how people develop a relationship
  with a source that they trust, and how an immersive experience differs from a utilitarian one.
  Expanding the Ambitious Learner segment will give the client the opportunity to gain further
  stakeholder investment, as well as to help the company to understand their users’ behaviors.
  These personas were also expanded upon to explain why a person might be dedicated to a
  resource, and why they might rely on it through and after transitional periods in their careers.</p>
  <p>The initial personas that were developed in this study did not accurately reflect the
  resulting personas created by the study’s close. The interviews with five young professional
  participants focused on their ideas of trust and how they use resources in their career path.
  Further analysis also revealed trends about the participants’ behaviors related to trust, loyalty,
  bias, and exploration styles. Trust comes in many varieties and people trust in a wide variety of
  things, from their bank, family, favorite football coach, shotgun, or themselves. While some
  people valued gaining absolute truths from their trusted figures, others looked for reliability or
  comfort. This wide range from a small demographic revealed some of the inaccuracies of the
  current market segment that is established at the company, with suggestions on how to improve
  and expand upon the current idea of what an Ambitious Learner’s behaviors are.</p>
  <p>Many conclusions were drawn based on these five participants, but this needs to be
  combined with further similar research in order to be validated. More persona research should
  be completed to find more concise patterns within the “Ambitious Learner” segment to hone in
  on the “Fast Tasker” and “Wanderer” personas that have emerged from this study. Also a
  continuation of research should inquire about more information on a person’s immediate
  motivation to access a resource (such as the client); for example, what question do they want
  answered by the time they have completed reading this article? The following research allows
  the client to dive deeper into their potential user base and to elaborate upon their market
  segments to cater more to the people who can best use the client’s resources.</p>
